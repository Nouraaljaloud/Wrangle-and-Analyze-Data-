# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
In this project, I was gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.
